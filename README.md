# React Portfolio

This is my portfolio which I have created using next.js, react, tailwind, three.js, and framer motion. It contain various projects which I used to help learn full-stack web development.

Most of the projects are from freeCodeCamp's online curriculum. Check them out at [https://freeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org).

I have also used various components from Aceternity UI. Check them out at [https://ui.aceternity.com](https://ui.aceternity.com).
