                    <p>
                        HTML (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>
                        anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web
                        page and its content. For example, content could be
                        structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of
                        bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML is a <i>markup language</i> that defines the
                        structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                        elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different
                        parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or
                        act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or
                        image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words,
                        can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example take the following line of content:</p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>
                        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could
                        specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                        paragraph tags:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    <br></br>

                    <p>
                        Let&apos;s explore this paragraph element a bit further.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                        alt="Paragraph Element Example"
                    />
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The opening tag: This consists of the name of the
                            element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and
                            closing angle brackets. This states where the
                            element begins or starts to take effect. In this
                            case where the paragraph begins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening
                            tag, except that it includes a forward slash before
                            the element name. This states where the element
                            ends. In this case where the paragraph ends. Failing
                            to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner
                            errors and can lead to strange results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The content: This is the content of the element,
                            which in this case, is just text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and
                            the content together comprise the element.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Elements can also have attributes that look like the
                        following:
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                        alt="Element Attribute Example"
                    />
                    <p>
                        Attributes contain extra information about the element
                        that you don&apos;t want to appear in the actual
                        content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute{" "}
                        <i>name</i> and <code>editor-note</code> is the
                        attribute <i>value</i>. The class attribute allows you
                        to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be
                        used to target it (and any other elements with the same{" "}
                        <code>class</code> value) with style information and
                        other things. Some attributes have no value, such as{" "}
                        <code>required</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A space between it and the element name (or the
                            previous attribute, if the element already has one
                            or more attributes).
                        </li>
                        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                        <li>
                            The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing
                            quotation marks.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Note: Simple attribute values that don&apos;t contain
                        ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters{" "}
                        <code>&quot; &apos; ` = &lt; &gt;</code>) can remain
                        unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all
                        attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent
                        and understandable.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section className="main-section" id="Nesting_Elements">
                    <header>Nesting Elements</header>
                    <p>
                        You can put elements inside other elements too. This is
                        called <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state that our
                        cat is <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word
                        &quot;very&quot; in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>{" "}
                        element, which means that the word is to be strongly
                        emphasized:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;My cat is <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>
                        very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        You do however need to make sure that your elements are
                        properly nested. In the example above, we opened the{" "}
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element first, then the{" "}
                        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element; therefore, we have
                        to close the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element first,
                        then the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The following
                        is incorrect:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very
                        grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The elements have to open and close correctly so that
                        they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they
                        overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try
                        to make the best guess at what you were trying to say,
                        which can lead to unexpected results. So don&apos;t do
                        it!
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section className="main-section" id="Void_Elements">
                    <header>Void Elements</header>
                    <p>
                        Some elements have no content and are called void
                        elements. Take this example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>{" "}
                        element:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;img src=&quot;images/firefox-icon.png&quot;
                        alt=&quot;My test image&quot; /&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        This contains two attributes, but there is no closing{" "}
                        <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag and no inner content. This
                        is because an image element doesn&apos;t wrap content to
                        affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML
                        page in the place it appears.

                        but they aren&apos;t handy on their own. Now we&apos;ll
                        look at how individual elements are combined to form an
                        entire HTML page. Here is an example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        {`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
      <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>
`}
                    </pre>
                    <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the doctype.
                            It is a required preamble. In the mists of time,
                            when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were
                            meant to act as links to a set of rules that the
                            HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML,
                            which could mean automatic error checking and other
                            useful things. However, these days, they don&apos;t
                            do much and are basically just needed to make sure
                            your document behaves correctly. That&apos;s all you
                            need to know for now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> is the{" "}
                            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element
                            wraps all the content on the entire page and is
                            sometimes known as the root element. It also
                            includes the lang attribute, setting the primary
                            language of the document.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> is the{" "}
                            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts
                            as a container for all the stuff you want to include
                            on the HTML page that isn&apos;t the content you are
                            showing to your page&apos;s viewers. This includes
                            things like keywords and a page description that you
                            want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
                            content, character set declarations, and more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</code>{" "}
                            This element sets the character set your document
                            should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters
                            from the vast majority of written languages.
                            Essentially, it can now handle any textual content
                            you might put on it. There is no reason not to set
                            this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>
                                &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;
                                content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
                            </code>
                            . This viewport element ensures the page renders at
                            the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers
                            from rendering pages wider than the viewport and
                            then shrinking them down.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> is the{" "}
                            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the
                            title of your page, which is the title that appears
                            in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also
                            used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite
                            it.

                            <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> is the{" "}
                            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all
                            the content that you want to show to web users when
                            they visit your page, whether that&apos;s text,
                            images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or
                            whatever else.
